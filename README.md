# Everyday Reproducibility Course

Before our course, we highly recommend that participants download and have installed the following pieces of software: 

1. jupyter lab [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) and/or [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). If you already have these installed, we recommend you update to the newest version. In particular, we will be making use of Rstudio's [quarto](https://quarto.org) which may require an update to a newer Rstudio version. 
2. [docker](https://www.docker.com). Much of the material for this course will be containerized in a docker container found at [hub.docker.com/r/gjhunt/repro](https://hub.docker.com/r/gjhunt/repro)
